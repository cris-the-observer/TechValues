# Techno‑Political Values Test

A fresh Vite + React app for the 12+1 axis techno‑political test with:
- Mixed question order (no axis clumps)
- Results hidden until completion
- Radar + color‑coded bar charts (Recharts)
- Minimal UI kit compatible with shadcn-style imports

## Quick start

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open the printed `http://localhost:5173/`.

## Build

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

## Notes

- UI components live in `src/components/ui/` and mimic shadcn/ui primitives.
- TailwindCSS is configured; classes are used throughout.
- Data export available from the Results screen.
